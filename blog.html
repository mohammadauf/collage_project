            <h2>What is Data Science?</h2>
            <p> Data Science can be explained as the entire process of gathering actionable insights from raw data that
                involves various concepts that include statistical analysis, data analysis, machine learning algorithms,
                data modeling, preprocessing of data, etc.</p>

            <h6>How does Data Science Work?</h6>
            The working of data science can be explained as follows: <br>

            <li>Raw data is gathered from various sources that explains the business problem.</li>
            <li>Using various statistical analysis, and machine learning approaches, data modeling is performed to get
                the optimum solutions that best explain the business problem.</li>

            <h2>Top 3 Programming Languages To Learn in 2022</h2>
            <p>A programming language refers to the means of communication that is used by humans to instruct computers
                to perform specified tasks. These languages use particular coding syntax to create programs to perform
                specialized tasks. Software programming is a lucrative career option. As per the survey, programming
                jobs are expected to rise by 21% by the year 2028. Wikipedia claims that there are around 700
                programming languages. So deciding which one to learn can be confusing.</p>

            Python can be regarded as the future of programming languages. As per the latest statistics, Python is the
            main coding language for around 80% of developers. The presence of extensive libraries in Python facilitates
            artificial intelligence, data science, and machine learning processes. Currently, Python is trending and can
            be regarded as the king of programming languages. It is also an absolutely interesting language for
            beginners and at Geeksforgeeks we have curated a special Python Programming Foundation -Self-Paced course
            where one can learn all the basics in one place. So learning this programming language in 2022 promises you
            success and growth.
            <p>It is one of the most lucrative languages that offers amazing features like:</p>
